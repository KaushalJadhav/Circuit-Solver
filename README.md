<H1> Circuit Solver </H1>
<P>
A project based on solving voltages and currents using graph theory.Circuits represented as collection of nodes and branches
<br>
<H2> Installation instructions- </H2>
<H3> With pip </H3>
  <ul> 
    <li> Install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
    </li>
  </ul>
<H3> Usage </H3>
  <ul>
    <li> Run run.py
    </li> 
  </ul>
<H2> Instructions for writing the input- </H2>
<ul> 
<li> Sequence to be followed - [Branch source node, Branch destination node, Resistance in branch,Capacitance in branch,Inductance in branch,Associated voltage source,Associated current source ] </li>
<li> While writing voltages and currents maintain the following format- magnitude,frequency&ltangle(in degrees)
</ul>
