<H1> Circuit Solver </H1>
<P>
A project based on solving voltages and currents using graph theory.Circuits represented as collection of nodes and branches
<br>
<H2> Installation instructions- </H2>

<H2> Instructions for writing the input- </H2>
<ul> 
<li> Sequence to be followed - [Branch source node, Branch destination node, Resistance in branch,Capacitance in branch,Inductance in branch,Associated voltage source,Associated current source ] </li>
<li> While writing voltages and currents maintain the following format- magnitude,frequency&ltangle
